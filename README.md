In this study, it is aimed to rotate in a way that minimum vehicles and minimum roads can be traveled by vehicles with different transportation volumes belonging to a company. The double tournament method was used in the study. At the end of the study, after adjusting the number of generations and individuals made according to the number of vehicles, saving values were produced. The application developed for the solution of the problem with Genetic Algortima is written in c # (sharp) programming language.
